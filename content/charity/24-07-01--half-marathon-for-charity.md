For the past 10 years or more, I have wanted to run a marathon.
Sadly, due to the fact that I sit at my desk all day for work and personal enjoyment (why is ðŸ¦€ Rust so good?!), I have not been able to get into the shape that I would need to be in for running a marathon.
Thankfully, over the past few months I have been able to get into a routine of running, strength exercises and working-out, and I am finally starting to see some progress.

After much thought and consideration, I have decided that I want to run a half marathon!

## The Run

I have chosen to run [The AJ Bell Great Scottish Run][half-marathon] in October 2024, and I am hoping to raise money for [Cancer Research UK][charity] in the process.
The run is about 21km / 13 miles across the city of Glasgow, and I am hoping to complete it in around 2 hours (less if I can manage it).

The run is a great opportunity for me to push myself and to raise money for a good cause, so I am really looking forward to it.

## Charity & Donations

If you would like to donate to my charity run, you can do so by visiting my [donations page][donations].
I am hoping to raise Â£500 for [Cancer Research UK][charity], and I would greatly appreciate any help that you can give.
