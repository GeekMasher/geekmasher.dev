One of the things I love doing in the evenings is going to meetups and annually to conferences.
Here are pages to the different types of events I attend.

- [InfoSec - Meetups](/pages/events/security-meetups)
- [InfoSec - Conferences](/pages/events/security-conferences)
- [Developer - Meetups](/pages/events/developer-meetups)
- [Developer - Conferences](/pages/events/developer-conferences)
