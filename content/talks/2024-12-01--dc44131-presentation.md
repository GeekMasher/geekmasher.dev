Yesterday I did a talk at my [local Defcon chapter DC44131][DC44131] in Edinburgh on 'Konarr: A Story of Building a Software Composition Analysis Platform'.

This talk focuses on my journey of building a [Software Composition Analysis][sca] platform called [Konarr][konarr].
I cover the reasons for building the platform, the technologies used, and the challenges faced.

This talk was a great opportunity to share my experiences and knowledge with the local security community.
I also wanted to highlight the importance of Software Composition Analysis and how it can help secure your Homelab running Containers.

The talk was well received and I had some great questions and feedback from the audience.
I have included the slides from the talk below and the resources mentioned in the talk.
