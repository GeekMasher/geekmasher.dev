At the start of May I did a talk at my [local Defcon chapter DC44131][DC44131] in Edinburgh on an 'Introduction to CodeQL'.

The talk focuses at people that don't have much knowledge of Static Code Analaysis or CodeQL but are interested in learning more.
I covered quite a few different topics in the presentation:

- [What is Static Code Analysis and CodeQL?](https://presentations.geekmasher.dev/2023-05-Defcon44131#5)
- [Running CodeQL to do research](https://presentations.geekmasher.dev/2023-05-Defcon44131#14)
- [Introduction to Query writing](https://presentations.geekmasher.dev/2023-05-Defcon44131#19)

Sadly the talk was not recorded but [there was a great Tweet](https://twitter.com/DC44131/status/1653099562960052230).
