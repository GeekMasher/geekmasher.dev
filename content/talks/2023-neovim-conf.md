In November 2023, I decided to apply to the CFP for the [NeovimConf][neovim-conf] online conference.
Fortunately I was accepted and presented my presentation on "Using Neovim to Help Develop Secure Code".

This short talk focuses on the [Neovim][neovim] Plugin I wrote to help me, and hopefully others, to run security tools in make applications more secure.
This plugin is called [DevSecInspect.nvim][DevSecInspect] and is open source for anyone to use

Here is the recording I submitted to NeovimConf.
