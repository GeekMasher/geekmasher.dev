This is my first post on my newly created blog at [https://geekmasher.dev](https://geekmasher.dev), please join my journey towards becoming a better developer and security engineer.

## The domain

A few months ago, I discovered that [Google allows you to register .dev domains](https://domains.google/tld/dev/) and I jumped at the opportunity.

I have a few domains under my name but this one is by far the coolest and well suited to the goal of my blog posts.

## Using `gatsbyjs`

[GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org/) is an awesome React based framework for building beautify static web applications.
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript front end development framework built by Facebook as an [open source project](https://github.com/facebook/react/).

It allows developers to build modular components that can then be brought together to build awesome single page applications.
If you are not familiar with with React it might be a little bit of a learning curve due to using [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) syntax but it's worth the ending results.

You can [start learning React here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## Using `lumen` theme

My last blog I built my own theme from scratch but this time I decided to use one of the many [starter theme/templates](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2) on GatsbyJS's website.

After looking at many of them, I ended up going for the [Lumen](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/) theme from [Alexander Shelepenok](https://github.com/alxshelepenok) which is [open source](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) and awesome for anyone to use.

## Using `now`

The final part of the puzzle was to find a great platform to deploy my static site.
In the past I used [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) but this time around I'm using [now](https://zeit.co/now) or [now.sh](https://now.sh) from [Zeit](https://zeit.co/home).

GatsbyJS blog post on [how to deploy GatsbyJS to now](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-to-now/) is an excellent a quick resource to get you started.

## Conclusion

My `React`, `gatsbyjs`, and `now` stack is awesome and I highly recommend any one using it
