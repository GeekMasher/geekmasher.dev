> Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.
> It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther...
> And then one fine morning—So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. - F Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby


## The Catalyst

After around 3 years running [a GatsbyJS based blog written in JavaScript / TypeScript](/posts/geekmasher.dev-my-first-post/), I have moved away from this tech-stack for a number of reasons.
Some good, some bad.

For the 1st year (the honeymoon pririod), GatsbyJS was great.
I could customise to my hearts content, use tons of awesome JavaScript frameworks, etc.
But I started having second thoughts.

Every time I `cd`-ed in into my blog directory or went on the GitHub repository page to start up a new post, I had a couple of thoughts.

The first thing was the number of security issues I kept on getting due to the massive amounts of dependencies used by Gatsby.
These alerts came from both [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts) (native in GitHub and PR creation) and [Synk](https://snyk.io/series/open-source-security/software-composition-analysis-sca/) (weekly emails and PRs creation) which are great tools but due to the nature of the blog, all of the security issues were irrelevant due to the threat model and risk of the blog.

In some cases for certain dependencies, at the time there was no security patches for certain packages I was using; For example, [PR for `gatsby-remark-relative-images`](https://github.com/danielmahon/gatsby-remark-relative-images/pull/22).

The second being [the code itself](https://github.com/GeekMasher/geekmasher.dev/tree/a9d76d75a50a1d81e13702af2ac1a272cc020876/src).
I have a lot of custom JavaScript / TypeScript code for my blog due to the heavy customisations I was doing to get the blog I wanted.
This came with the benefit of learning ReactJS and some UI development but now I want to move away from maintaining all this code.

These were some of the factors that made it hard for me to write blog posts and distracting.
I need my full concentration before writing a post and not get distracted by my bad TypeScript code code or non-existent security issues.
This means a change must happen...

I've dumped Gatsby, hello Hugo... 


## What and why Hugo?

Hugo is a static site generator written in Go which generates HTML from Markdown files.
There is a massive community behind Hugo and with fantastic support for many features such as using [GoLang's templating syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) to create templates and re-usable components.

So now that's answer what was the reason for picking Hugo.
Well, it was simple: No code, no problem.

Of course there is code but I'm not the main maintainer of that code which is done by the awesome devs over in the [Hugo repo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo).
This means all of the custom code I spent hours writing and hours figuring out how it worked is not gone.

Dependency wise, I've dramatically reduced the dependencies I'm using from 1,900 NPM packages to now XXX.

One of the smaller factors was that non-JavaScript now can access all the blogs content without having to download and read the JSON content files.
GatsbyJS being a React based framework rendered everything using JavaScript and when JavaScript was disabled, the blog would just not work.
This is a pain for some users and now has been completely eliminated as everything in Hugo is generated prior to deployment.
Only one small component uses JavaScript now which isn't needed.


## Why not use Jekyll?

Well, that would be a great question if not for one fact:

> Jekyll is a blog-aware static site generator in Ruby - Jekyll GitHub Repository

I think I'll hedge my bets and [use Go over Ruby](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology).

I joke all you Ruby fans but it was a small factor in picking the framework to use.


## Theme and Customisations

I'm using a theme called [mini (or hugo-theme-mini)](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini) which is a simple and clean theme for a blog.

I have customised the templates a little to make it a little more "me" but very little compared to GatsbyJS.

Extending the theme to suit my needs was very easy and straight forward.
I used vanilla CSS and JavaScript to get all the features that I wanted.
This is both good and bad as you can't use nice nice SCSS or front-end frameworks but this makes it far easier.

The only JavaScript present on the page is the front-page profile header which even need to be run.


## Deployment

One of the only things that is staying is the use of Vercel / now.sh (RIP now.sh, amazing name and domain).

I can't say much more apart form [how easy it was to deploy a Hugo blog to Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-hugo-with-vercel) with very little effort.
A cloud service which is easier then anything else in the market makes me very, very happy.

\*cough cough\*... AWS. \*cough cough\*... Azure.


## Conclusion

Hugo has make my life far easier since I converted my blog this month.
I wanted to focus more on write content and not messing with the blog every time I started a new post.

So far, I highly recommend Hugo over GatsbyJS but keep in mind GatsbyJS has some feature Hugo does or is poor at.
