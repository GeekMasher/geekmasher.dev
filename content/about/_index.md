Greetings and salutations, my name is Mathew Payne also known online as [@GeekMasher][geekmasher-github] and I'm a lover of Technology<!--:technologist:-->, Information Security :lock:, and Developing<!-- :keyboard: --> :wrench: in a number of languages.

Now I'm currently working as a Field Security Architect at [Github :octocat:][github].

<!-- Spare time -->
In my spare time I read about technology & Business :book:, do some PC or PS4 gaming :video_game:, and write code :computer: in Python, JavaScript, or GoLang.

## The journey so far...

<!-- University -->
Before I started my professional career, I went to University of [Abertay in Dundee][abertay] :mortar_board:, in Scotland <!--:unicorn: -->studying [Ethical Hacking and Countermeasures (now just Ethical Hacking)][abertay-eh].
The course got me thinking more like a security expert and thought me a lot about Cyber Security. 

<!-- Career -->
My whole career has revolved around Application Security and securing software from malicious threat actors.
At the start of my career I was a consultant focused on Pen Testing but I also dipped my toes into other different areas including Threat Modelling, Network Security Testing, Training, and massively into Code Reviewing.

My love for Code Review and looking for security bugs in software lead me to use Static Code Analysis tools.
This then lead me to join a large Static Application Security Testing (SAST) company which allowed me to focus on my love for code review and helping companies secure their software.

Now I'm currently working as a Field Security Architect at Github where I help customers understand the value of Static Code Analysis and help them achieve their goals securing their software.
